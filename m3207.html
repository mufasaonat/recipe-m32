    <h1>How to make "Fried Rice"</h1>

    <h2>1.In a pot or a rice cooker liner, place your rice (of preferred measure). Add water and rinse the rice three or more times, or until water is clear, then drain. This rinsing method will take away the extra starch and dirt from the rice.</h2>
    
    <h2>2.Next, you add in the water for cooking. Do note that if you want fried rice, you will want your rice to be just a little drier because you will rehydrate this rice with all the sauces in your fried rice recipe! For this, a good rule of thumb is: 1 cup of rice = 1 cup of water. </h2>
      <li>First Knuckle Method: Level out your rice and place your finger vertically just right on top of rice (barely touching) and pour in water up until just before your first knuckle. </li>
      <li>Finger Measure Method: You can also measure the rice by sinking in your finger vertically, touching the bottom of the pan and using your thumb to mark up to where the rice comes up to your middle finger. Then lift your hand to the top layer of the leveled rice and fill the pot with water to the mark you just made with your thumb. </li>
      <li>Measuring Cup: If you are using jasmine rice, a good rule of thumb is to use 1 ¼ cups of water or less. If you find this to be too dry, you can still add in more water.</li>
    <h2>3.If you are using a rice cooker, simply follow the cooking instructions of the manufacturer and wait for rice to cook!</h2>
    
    <h2>4.For those using a pot: Cook the rice in medium heat until the water comes to a simmer, then continue cooking at the lowest level of heat for about 15-20 minutes. Be sure to keep the lid on the pot. </h2> 
    
    <h2>5.Take it off the heat once you notice that bubbling has stopped and the rice has absorbed the water. Get a rubber spatula and from the side of the pot check to see if the bottom of your pan is still wet. If it is dry, you’re good to go!</h2>
    
    <h2>6.Fluff your rice and serve!</li>
