    <h1>Tom Yum Kung</h1>
    <h3>This is the most popular Tom Yum soup that the people around the world want to taste it.</h3>

    <h1>The Ingredient</h1>
    <h2>Makrut lime leaves (previously known as kaffir lime leaves). Look for makrut lime leaves at stores that sell Southeast Asian products, and if fresh isn't available, look for frozen. Dried can work, but double the amount. 
        For more info, read my guide to makrut lime leaves.</h2>
        <h2>Lemongrass. Fresh is best as it is the main flavour of the soup, but whole frozen lemongrass is fine (not chopped). Dried isn't ideal, but it's workable; you'll have to experiment with amounts but you can keep adding until the flavour really comes through. Do not use powdered.
             For more on lemongrass including how to freeze it, read my ultimate guide to lemongrass.</h2>
             <h2>Galangal. That's the knobby thing that looks a bit like ginger. Look for galangal at stores that sell Southeast Asian products, and if fresh isn't available, look for frozen. Dried pieces of galangal will also work in a pinch. Do not substitute with ginger, which tastes very different.
                 For more on galangal including how to freeze it, read my ultimate guide to galangal.</h2>
                 <h2>Thai chilies, the amount is to taste, but tom yum is supposed to be a spicy soup so I would add at least 1.</h2>
                 <h2>Thai chilli paste/chili jam. Known as nam prik pao in Thai, this is a sweet-savoury thick paste that you can buy or make at home using this recipe. 
                    See more on this ingredient, including how to make tom yum without it below.</h2>
                    <h2>Fresh lime juice. Fresh is the key word here.</h2>
                    <h2>Fish sauce. Use good quality fish sauce as it is the main seasoning. Read more about fish sauce here including brand recommendations.</h2>
                    <h2>Sugar. You may or may not need it, depending on the sweetness of your Thai chili paste.</h2>
                    <h2>Oyster mushrooms, or another type of Asian mushrooms such as shimeji, enoki or fresh shiitake. If you can find them, straw mushrooms are the most common type used in tom yum in Thailand. 
                        Don't use button mushrooms, they're not nearly as good in soups.</h2>
                        <h2>Cilantro for garnish, or you can also use sawtooth coriander (culantro) which is also common. 
                            Sub green onions if you don't like cilantro.</h2>
     <h1>The recipe</h1>
     <h2>1.For the shrimp stock (skip to step 5 if using chicken stock): Peel and devein the shrimp, adding all shells and heads into a stock pot.</h2>
     <h2>2.Add a little oil, chopped daikon and/or onion into the shrimp shells.</h2>
     <h2>3.Saute the shells over medium high heat, pressing on the heads to get out the tomalley.</h2>
     <h2>4.Once the shells are all orange, and the bits stuck to the bottom of the bot start to brown, add the water and bring to a simmer; simmer for 5 minutes.
</h2>
<h2>5.Prep the herbs: Using only the bottom half of the lemongrass, cut Â½-inch off the root end and then smash the stalk with the back of your knife or a pestle.
</h2>
<h2>6.Thinly slice the galangal. If you have frozen whole galangal, allow it to partially thaw at room temp for 10-15 minutes, until it's soft enough to slice; do not let it completely thaw.
</h2>
<h2>7.Twist the makrut lime leaves to bruise, then tear into chunks, removing the center ribs.
</h2>
<h2>8.Pound the Thai chilies into a rough paste, or finely mince them.
</h2>
<h2>9.Once the shrimp are done, scoop out the shells and discard. Measure out 4 cups of the stock then add to the pot. If you have a bit more, that's okay, if you don't have enough, add water to make up the shortfall.
</h2>
<h2>10.Add the herbs, the chilies, and the mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes.
</h2>
<h2>11.Add the fish sauce and the Thai chili paste (it will help to loosen the chili paste first with a bit of the broth so it will dissolve more easily in the soup.)
</h2>
<h2>12.Bring the soup back to a boil, then add the shrimp and cook until halfway done, 30-45 seconds, then turn off the heat and allow the residual heat of the soup to fully cook the shrimp.
</h2>
<h2>13.Add the lime juice and then taste and adjust seasoning. Tom yum should lead with sour, but if it tastes too sour, add the sugar to balance. Tom yum is supposed to be served with rice, so it should taste strong on its own, but if you'll eat it on its own and it feels too strong, you can dilute it with some hot water.
</h2>
<h2>14.Stir in chopped cilantro or green onions.
</h2>
<h2>15.Serve with jasmine rice, and to eat it like a Thai, make 1-2 simple things to go along with it. I highly recommend a Thai omelette which is super easy and my favourite pairing with tom yum goong!
