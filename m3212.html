    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>How to make omelette</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, crack two eggs in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Season the raw eggs with fish sauce, one teaspoon for one egg.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg with the fish sauce until it is fluffy and homogeneous.</li>
        <li>Heat sufficient vegetable oil at least one inch in depth in a wok.</li>
        <li>When the oil is sufficiently hot, pour the beaten eggs about one foot above the wok. This height helps to create more bubbles and make it fluffier.</li>
        <li>Maintain medium-high heat and do not disturb the egg for the first 20 seconds, to let the egg set. If your oil is at the right temperature, you will observe that the egg will puff up quickly.</li>
        <li>After that, carefully move the egg slowly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>When the edges turn golden, lift the omelet with a spatula to check if the bottom has already turned golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the omelet over and continue frying the other side for another 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Remove the omelet with a large wire mesh strainer when both sides have turned golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the omelet to a paper towel to absorb as much oil as possible.</li>
        <li>Garnish the omelet with some spring onions (green onions) or coriander leaf to serve.</li>
    </ol>
