    <p>Creme Brulee also known as burnt cream. Creme Brulee is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar.</p>
    <p>It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. 
        The custard base is generally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit.</p>

        <li>Egg yolks</li>

        <li>Vanilla</li>

    <h3>How to make Crème Brûlée</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrape vanilla bean - To scrape the vanilla bean “caviar” (seeds) out, cut an incision down the length of the vanilla bean. 
            Then use the back of a small knife held perpendicular against the vanilla bean and scrape it along the inside to scrape out the vanilla bean seeds.</li>
        <li>Infuse cream - Place vanilla seeds, empty vanilla bean pod and cream in a saucepan, and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. 
            Then leave to stand for 1 hour so the cream is infused with the vanilla flavour and cools</li>
        <li>Make egg mixture - Whisk egg yolks with the sugar</li>
        <li>Add cream - Remove the vanilla bean from the cream and add cream into it</li>
        <li>Make custard - Pour the cream into the egg mixture then whisk until just combined</li>
        <li>Fill ramekins - This recipe makes 500ml / 2 cups of custard, so thats four servings of 125ml / ½ cup each. Small ramekins holding around 150ml / ⅔ cup are an ideal size</li>
        <li>Water bath - Place ramekins in a deep(-ish) roasting pan, then fill the pan with boiling water so it comes halfway up the side of the ramekins</li>
        <li>Bake 35 - 40 minutes or until the custard looks and feels set but still wobbles when you (gently!) shake the ramekin.</li>
    </ul>
