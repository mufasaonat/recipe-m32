    <h2>How to make</h2>
     <!--Number-->
    <ul>
        <li> Mix sugar, yeast, water, sweetened fresh milk, salt, eggs, all-purpose flour and unsalted butter in a mixing bowl. <br>Knead by hand for about 40 minutes, then let it rest for 30 minutes until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Take the dough that has risen and pound it to release the air and let it rest for another 30 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a 1 cm thick layer. Then, use the bottom of a glass and a cookie cutter to press the dough and let the donut dough rise.</li>
        <li>Put soybean fat for frying donuts in a pan or pot. Use medium heat to fry until both sides are white and fluffy. <br>Then, let it turn yellow one side at a time. This will give you white edges. Scoop it up and drain the oil. </li>
    </ul>
