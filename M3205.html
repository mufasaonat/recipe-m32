    <h2>Broath recipe</h2>
    <p>"Boat noodles" is a direct translation from the Thai name, guay tiew ruea. It's so named because 
        originally they were actually sold from boats along Bangkok's canals; 
        though nowadays most vendors have moved on land, and you can find them all over the country.</p>
    <p>This is why boat noodles in Thailand come in little bowls - it wasn't practical to pass around 
        large bowls of hot soup on a wobbly boat. So it's not uncommon for someone to eat 3-5 boat noodle bowls in one meal!</p>

    <p>The heart of boat noodles is the uniquely aromatic and rich broth. 
        The broth is dark thanks to the various soy sauces, and it has a lot of herbs and spices infused into it. 
        The most unique part about boat noodles is that it is extra rich due to the added blood! (Before you get squeamish, it doesn't taste like blood at all, but it's optional.)</p>

    <h2>Broath recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork neck bones, are my favourite bones to use for the broth because they have a lot of meat on them which will become tender and delicious when we're done. 
            But you can also use pork back bones, beef bones or veal bones.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon stick, crush it just until broken into smaller pieces so it'll be easier to toast</li>
        <li>Star anise</li>
        <li>Coriander seeds</li>
        <li>Galangal, sliced into thin rounds. If you don't have it, it's fine to omit or use dried galangal.</li>
        <li>Cilantro roots or cilantro stems. Smash them gently just to bruise and release the flavour.</li>
        <li>Daikon, peeled and cut into big chunks. This helps sweeten the broth and make it extra delish. 
            WIthout it, you can add more onion instead. Once done, the daikon will also be super delicious, 
            so don't throw them away! Serve it with the noodles or save it for another meal.</li>
        <li>Onion, cut into big chunks</li>
        <li>Garlic, crushed until broken to help release the flavour</li>
        <li>White pepper, ground. Black pepper is fine too.</li>
        <li>Pandan leaf, optional. Pandan leaves are used mostly in desserts, but it's commonly added to boat noodles. 
            You won't taste the pandan in the finished product, and it is fine to omit.</li>
        <li>Soy sauce. I use Thai soy sauce but other kinds are fine.</li>
        <li>Golden Mountain Sauce. Golden Mountain is a brand of "Thai seasoning sauce" that is the most popular so the brand has become genericized. </li>
        <li>Taojiew, this is Thai fermented soybean paste; basically the Thai version of miso paste. 
            You can sub miso or doenjang instead. If your taojiew looks particularly chunky, mash it with a fork so it distributes better.</li>
        <li>Thai black soy sauce or dark soy sauce. If using Chinese dark soy sauce it tends to be a bit salty, 
            so I'd hold back on the regular soy sauce and then add more as needed.</li>
        <li>Fish sauce </li>
        <li>White vinegar</li>
        <li>Rock sugar or granulated sugar. Rock sugar is traditional, but it'll make no difference whatsoever if you use granulated, so use it only if you already have it!</li>
        <li>Liquid beef or pork blood. You can find blood at some Asian grocery stores, usually frozen. 
            Do not buy cooked blood, which is solid, or fresh blood without the anticoagulant added.</li>
