    </p>Thai Green Curry in 30 minutes made by freshening up store bought curry paste OR with a homemade green curry paste! Whichever way you go, the one essential step to make a really great green curry is to fry off the curry paste.
    <h3>How to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Optional step: Pound green curry paste and Thai basil leaves for an extra vibrant colour.</li>
    <li>Get the paste as fine as possible.</li>
    <li>Reduce the coconut milk until very thick</li>
    <li>Add the curry paste and saute for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Toss chicken with the curry paste.</li>
    <li>Add coconut milk</li>
    <li>Add chicken stock</li>
    <li>Add makrut lime leaves.</li>
    <li>Add fish sauce and palm sugar.</li>
    <li>Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is fork tender.</li>
    <li>Add bamboo shoots and cook for a minute until the curry comes back to a boil.</li>
    <li>Stir in red bell pepper and turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Add Thai basil and stir just until wilted.</li>
    <li>The green curry is now ready to serve with jasmine rice! Note: The makrut lime leaves are for infusion purposes only; they are not meant to be eaten when left in large pieces.</li>
