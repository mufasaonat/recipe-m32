    <p>Homemade Sushi is so much cheaper than at the restaurant. Plus, it’s easy and fun to make your own rolls at home, so you can put all your favorite ingredients into your perfect custom roll </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!--Number Bullet-->
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
    <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>

    <h2>How to make</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed<li>
        <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
    </ol>
